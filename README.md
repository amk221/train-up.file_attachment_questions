# File-attachment Questions

## Installation

1. Simply drop this into your WordPress __plugins__ folder
2. Active the plugin from within WordPress

## What does it do?

It adds a new question type to your e-learning website that allows users to upload file(s) in response to a question.

When a user re-sits a Test, files from previous attempts _remain in the system_. Files can mount up fast, and so Train-Up! includes a feature for you to purge redundant files.

## Caveats

Unlike most other question types, file-attachment questions cannot be marked automatically and as such, Tests which contain a file-attachment question need to be manually published.

Marks cannot be awarded on a per-question basis, so the most common use-case is to have a Test with 1 question and to mark the overall Test instead.

### Why?

The [Train-Up!](wptrainup.co.uk) e-learning plugin for WordPress adds a training section to any WordPress website. 

The plugin itself comes with Multiple Choice and Single-answer questions built-in. Other question types such as this one can be added on separately.
